Creating a Subsurface bundle
============================

install gtk-mac-bundler (this has been tested with version 0.7.0) and run

  $ gtk-mac-bundler subsurface.bundle

This should install a self-contained Subsurface application under /Applications/Subsurface.app
You still need to manually build a DMG if you want to easily distribute this.

Caveats
-------

* You need (at least with MacPorts) to build pango like this:

  $ sudo port install pango +builtin_modules +no_x11 +quartz

Without the builtin modules the installed application fails to find the modules and doesn't render any text.

* It seems that gtk-mac-bundler expects the charset.alias file to be
  in the ${prefix}/lib folder which it isn't with the current version of
  MacPorts. The following fixes that:

  $ sudo cp /usr/lib/charset.alias /opt/local/lib

* libdivecomputer needs to be configured with --with-prefix=/opt/local
